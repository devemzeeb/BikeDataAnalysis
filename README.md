## BikeDataAnalysis
This project was a case study as part of the <b>Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</b> program. The purpose of this anlaysis is very simple. I want to answer how different types of members of a bike sharing company use their bikes differently.
The datasets are too big to upload to github for my account. But they are publicly available at [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) <br>
Have a look at the visual dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mizu/viz/BikeDataAnalysis_16788695816230/Dashboard)
