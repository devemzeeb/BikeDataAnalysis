# BikeDataAnalysis
This was part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The purpose of this anlaysis is very simple. I want to answer how different types of members of a bike sharing company use their bikes differently.
The datasets are too big to upload to github for my account. But it is publicly available at https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
